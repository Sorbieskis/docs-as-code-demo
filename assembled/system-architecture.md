# Project Structure Guide

This document outlines the repository's folder structure and the component-based authoring model used by Project Unidoc. Adhering to this structure is critical for ensuring the automation pipelines function correctly.

## 1. High-Level Repository Structure

The repository is organized to clearly separate source content, configuration, automation workflows, and final outputs.

```yaml
.
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── build-and-deploy.yml
│       └── ci.yml
├── docs/
│   ├── admin/
│   │   ├── config.yml
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── images/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── includes/
│   │   └── parts/
│   ├── manuals/
│   └── index.md
├── site/
├── tests/
├── .gitignore
├── mkdocs.yml
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── template.latex
```

-   `.github/workflows/`: Contains the CI/CD automation scripts.
-   `docs/`: This is the heart of the documentation, containing all source Markdown files and assets.
-   `docs/admin/`: Holds the configuration for the Decap CMS web editor.
-   `docs/content/`: Component-based content library for multi-manual system.
-   `docs/manuals/`: YAML assembly files defining manual structure.
-   `site/`: This directory is automatically generated by MkDocs during the build process and is ignored by Git.
-   `tests/`: Contains integration and unit tests for verifying the system's integrity.
-   `mkdocs.yml`: The primary configuration file for the MkDocs static site generator.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
-   `template.latex`: The master LaTeX template that defines the style and structure of all generated PDF documents.

# 2. Component-Based Authoring Model

To adhere to the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle, our manuals are not written as single, monolithic files. Instead, they are assembled from smaller, reusable components.

## Types of Content Files

1.  **Master Assembly Files (`docs/manuals/*.yml`)**
    * **Purpose:** These are the master files for a complete manual. Their main job is to define the structure of a manual and *include* the other components in the correct order. **This architecture enables infinite scalability** - adding new manuals requires only creating new assembly files that reference existing or new components.
    * **Scalability Benefits:**
        - **Template-driven consistency**: All manuals inherit the same professional structure
        - **Component reuse**: Common sections (safety, maintenance, contact info) are written once, used everywhere
        - **Zero-effort standardization**: New products automatically follow established documentation patterns
        - **Automated cross-manual updates**: Changes to shared components propagate instantly across all manuals
    * **Example (`docs/manuals/pekos-v2.yml`):**
        ```yaml
        title: "Pekos V2 Clamping System Manual"
        author: "Project Unidoc Team"
        date: "2025-01-30"
        chapters:
          - content/includes/company-header.md
          - content/parts/pekos-v2-introduction.md
          - content/parts/pekos-v2-installation.md
          - content/includes/standard-maintenance-schedule.md
        ```

2.  **Unique Part Files (`docs/content/parts/`)**
    * **Purpose:** This directory holds content that is unique to a specific machine or component. These are the substantial chapters of a manual.
    * **Examples:** `pekos-v2-installation.md`, `crs10-software-guide.md`.

3.  **Reusable Include Files (`docs/content/includes/`)**
    * **Purpose:** This directory is for "Lego bricks"—small, persistent snippets of content that are identical across multiple manuals.
    * **Examples:** `standard-safety-warnings.md`, `company-contact-info.md`.

## How It Comes Together

The build process is configured to understand YAML assembly files. When it builds a manual, it starts with the **Master Assembly File**, reads the list of chapters, and stitches them together into a single, complete document before converting it to its final format.
