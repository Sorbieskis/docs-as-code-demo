Solving Our Core Documentation Challenges
=========================================

"Project Unidoc" was designed to solve specific, long-standing problems with the previous documentation process. The old workflow, while familiar, created significant inefficiencies and quality control issues.

### Key Problems with the "Old Way"

-   **No Single Source of Truth**

    -   Scattered Word documents and PDFs on a shared drive led to constant version confusion. It was difficult to know which file was the latest, "official" version.

-   **Inefficient & Error-Prone Workflow**

    -   The process relied on manual copy-pasting of content between documents, which was time-consuming and a frequent source of human error.

-   **Lack of Version Control**

    -   There was no reliable way to track changes, review a document's history, or revert to a previous good state if a mistake was made.

-   **Inconsistent Quality & Branding**

    -   Formatting, branding, and style varied significantly between documents, appearing unprofessional to clients and confusing for internal users.

-   **No Safe Contribution Pathway**

    -   The old system provided no safe or structured way for subject matter experts to contribute directly. The new system's review workflow (Pull Requests) acts as a crucial quality gate, enabling anyone---from team leaders to other engineers---to propose changes without risk, eliminating bottlenecks and encouraging collaboration.
