# Project Structure Guide

This document outlines the repository's folder structure and the component-based authoring model used by Project Unidoc. Adhering to this structure is critical for ensuring the automation pipelines function correctly.

## 1. High-Level Repository Structure

The repository is organized to clearly separate source content, configuration, automation workflows, and final outputs.


      
      
```yaml
.
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── build-and-deploy.yml
│       └── ci.yml
├── docs/
│   ├── admin/
│   │   ├── config.yml
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── images/
│   ├── includes/
│   ├── parts/
│   └── index.md
├── site/
├── tests/
├── .gitignore
├── mkdocs.yml
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── template.latex
```

    

    


-   `.github/workflows/`: Contains the CI/CD automation scripts.
-   `docs/`: This is the heart of the documentation, containing all source Markdown files and assets.
-   `docs/admin/`: Holds the configuration for the Decap CMS web editor.
-   `site/`: This directory is automatically generated by MkDocs during the build process and is ignored by Git.
-   `tests/`: Contains integration and unit tests for verifying the system's integrity.
-   `mkdocs.yml`: The primary configuration file for the MkDocs static site generator.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
-   `template.latex`: The master LaTeX template that defines the style and structure of all generated PDF documents.

## 2. Component-Based Authoring Model

To adhere to the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle, our manuals are not written as single, monolithic files. Instead, they are assembled from smaller, reusable components.

### Types of Content Files

1.  **Master Assembly Files (`docs/manual-*.md`)**
    * **Purpose:** These are the master files for a complete manual. Their main job is to define the structure of a manual and *include* the other components in the correct order. **This architecture enables infinite scalability** - adding new manuals requires only creating new assembly files that reference existing or new components.
    * **Scalability Benefits:**
        - **Template-driven consistency**: All manuals inherit the same professional structure
        - **Component reuse**: Common sections (safety, maintenance, contact info) are written once, used everywhere
        - **Zero-effort standardization**: New products automatically follow established documentation patterns
        - **Automated cross-manual updates**: Changes to shared components propagate instantly across all manuals
    * **Example (`docs/manual-pekos-v2.md`):**
        ```markdown
        # Pekos V2 Clamping System Manual

        {!includes/standard-safety-warnings.md!}
        {!parts/pekos-v2-introduction.md!}
        {!parts/pekos-v2-installation.md!}
        {!includes/standard-maintenance-schedule.md!}
        ```

2.  **Unique Part Files (`docs/parts/`)**
    * **Purpose:** This directory holds content that is unique to a specific machine or component. These are the substantial chapters of a manual.
    * **Examples:** `pekos-v2-installation.md`, `crs10-software-guide.md`.

3.  **Reusable Include Files (`docs/includes/`)**
    * **Purpose:** This directory is for "Lego bricks"—small, persistent snippets of content that are identical across multiple manuals.
    * **Examples:** `standard-safety-warnings.md`, `company-contact-info.md`.

### How It Comes Together

The build process is configured to understand this include syntax. When it builds a manual, it starts with the **Master Assembly File**, reads the list of includes, and stitches them together into a single, complete document before converting it to its final format.
