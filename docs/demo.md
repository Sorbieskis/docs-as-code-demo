# Live Demonstration & Next Steps

This section will demonstrate the core workflow that makes the Project Unidoc system so powerful: enabling a non-technical user to safely contribute a change that is then automatically published.

### Live Demo Workflow

1.  **Showcase Final PDF:** First, we'll look at a professionally formatted PDF generated by the system's LaTeX pipeline.

2.  **Edit as a Team Leader:** Using the Decap CMS web interface, I will assume the role of a Team Leader and make a simple, visible change to a manual.

3.  **Review as Technical Owner:** I will switch back to my role, showing the automatically created Pull Request in GitHub. This is the critical quality control gate.

4.  **Trigger Automation:** By approving and merging the change, the automated GitHub Actions workflow will begin.

5.  **Observe Automation:** We will watch the workflow run in real-time, building and deploying the outputs.

### The Path Forward

While the automation runs, we can discuss the next steps.

The process you are seeing demonstrates a superior, safer, and more efficient workflow that directly addresses the problems of the old system.

**My recommendation is to formally adopt the Project Unidoc system as the standard process for all new and updated technical documentation company-wide.**
