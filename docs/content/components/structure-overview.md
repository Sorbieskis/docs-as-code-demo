# Project Structure Guide

This document outlines the repository's folder structure and the component-based authoring model used by Project Unidoc. Adhering to this structure is critical for ensuring the automation pipelines function correctly.

## 1. High-Level Repository Structure

The repository is organized to clearly separate source content, configuration, automation workflows, and final outputs.
