**The 3-Step Manual Creation Process:**
1. **Write** - Content creators focus purely on writing in Markdown
2. **Review** - Automated pull request workflow ensures quality control  
3. **Publish** - Simultaneous generation of website and print-ready PDF

This streamlined process reduces manual creation time from weeks to hours.
