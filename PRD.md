Of course. Here is a comprehensive, in-depth Product Requirements Document for the presentation website itself. This is designed to be used as a direct blueprint for an AI to generate the content for each page.

# Product Requirements Document: Aethelred Presentation Site
**Author:** Deimonas Suchanka
**Status:** Version 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-31

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1. Project Title
Aethelred Demo Site: A Narrative & Functional Showcase

### 1.2. Problem Statement
A traditional slide deck (e.g., PowerPoint) is insufficient to demonstrate the dynamic, automated, and interactive nature of the Aethelred documentation system. A static presentation cannot effectively convey the benefits of a live, searchable manual or a real-time, automated build process.

### 1.3. Vision Statement
To create a self-contained, interactive MkDocs website that serves as the presentation itself. The site will guide key stakeholders (Rob and Jan) through a compelling narrative, moving from the impressive final product to the problems it solves, the underlying architecture, and a live demonstration of its capabilities, culminating in a clear call to action.

### 1.4. Target Audience
* **Primary:** Rob (Software Lead & Owner), Jan (General Manager).
* **Key Goals:**
    * **For Rob:** Showcase technical elegance, robust automation, and strategic value through potential integration with existing .NET software.
    * **For Jan:** Demonstrate increased efficiency, improved quality control, enhanced professionalism, and a clear, modern workflow for the company.

## 2. Website Structure & Page Requirements

The website will consist of five distinct pages, arranged in a specific narrative order in the site navigation.

### **Page 1: A New Standard (The "Hook")**

* **Purpose:** To immediately capture attention by showcasing the most polished, user-facing output of the Aethelred system. This leads with the "wow" factor before any explanation.
* **Content & Narrative:**
    1.  **Primary Headline:** "A New Standard for Our Documentation"
    2.  **Introduction Paragraph:** Briefly state that this page demonstrates the high-quality, professional standard now achievable for all company manuals.
    3.  **Core Demo Asset (Live Action):** The presenter will launch the software manual `.exe` file (generated by Tauri) from their desktop.
        * **Narrative Points during Demo:**
            * "This isn't a webpage or a PDF; it's a standalone desktop application."
            * "It's fast, fully searchable, and works completely offline, which is perfect for service engineers on-site."
            * (Demonstrate the live search feature to find a specific term instantly).
            * "This is the professional experience we can now deliver."
* **Assets Required:**
    * The pre-generated `.exe` file of the software manual, ready to be launched.

### **Page 2: The Problem: The Old Way (The "Why")**

* **Purpose:** To provide context and justification for the new system by clearly outlining the business problems with the previous workflow.
* **Content & Narrative:**
    1.  **Primary Headline:** "Solving Our Core Documentation Challenges"
    2.  **Introduction Paragraph:** State that the new system was designed to solve specific, long-standing problems with the old process.
    3.  **Bulleted List of Problems:**
        * **No Single Source of Truth:** "Scattered Word documents on a shared drive led to version confusion."
        * **Inefficient & Error-Prone:** "Manual copy-pasting of content was time-consuming and led to mistakes."
        * **Lack of Version Control:** "There was no reliable way to track changes, review history, or revert to a previous good state."
        * **Inconsistent Quality:** "Formatting and branding varied significantly between documents, appearing unprofessional."
        * **Barrier to Collaboration:** "Fear of overwriting work meant that subject matter experts were hesitant to contribute directly."
* **Assets Required:** None.

### **Page 3: The Solution: Aethelred System (The "How")**

* **Purpose:** To explain the architecture of the solution, focusing on how it addresses the problems and its strategic value, specifically for Rob and Jan.
* **Content & Narrative:**
    1.  **Primary Headline:** "The Aethelred System: An Automated & Strategic Solution"
    2.  **Section 1: The Workflow:**
        * **Sub-headline:** "How We Work Now"
        * **Content:** Embed the user workflow diagram (`Untitled Diagram.drawio.png`). Briefly explain the roles and the handoff process (Team Leader edits -> Owner reviews -> Automation builds).
    3.  **Section 2: The Technology:**
        * **Sub-headline:** "The Technical Architecture"
        * **Content:** Embed the technical architecture diagram (`Untitled Diagram.drawio(1).png`). Explain the core components: GitHub as the central hub, GitHub Actions as the automation engine, and the parallel build jobs.
    4.  **Section 3: Strategic Value (Key Narrative for Rob & Jan):**
        * **Sub-headline:** "Built for the Future"
        * **Content:**
            * **Modularity:** "The system is designed with a 'Lego block' approach. As we standardize our machines, this architecture will enable us to automatically generate custom manuals for specific configurations."
            * **.NET Integration (For Rob):** "Crucially, the website output is clean, standard HTML. This means we can directly integrate this documentation into the central .NET application. We can have a 'Help' tab right inside the software that is always perfectly in sync with the latest manuals, with zero extra development effort."
* **Assets Required:**
    * Image file of the user workflow diagram.
    * Image file of the technical architecture diagram.

### **Page 4: Live Demo & Next Steps (The "Proof")**

* **Purpose:** To provide irrefutable proof that the system works as described and to present the clear call to action.
* **Content & Narrative:**
    1.  **Primary Headline:** "Live Demonstration"
    2.  **Content:** This page can be minimal, perhaps with just a list of the demo steps. The focus is on the presenter's live actions.
    3.  **Live Demo Steps:**
        * **Show PDF:** First, showcase a finished, professionally formatted PDF generated by the LaTeX pipeline.
        * **Non-Technical Edit:** Open the private Netlify/Vercel URL for the Decap CMS editor (`/admin` page).
        * **Narrate:** "Let's say I'm a team leader and I need to update a procedure..."
        * **Action:** Make a small, obvious change and click "Publish."
        * **Show the PR:** Switch to the GitHub repository to show the automatically created Pull Request. Explain this is the quality control gate.
        * **Merge:** Click "Merge."
        * **Show Automation:** Immediately navigate to the "Actions" tab to show the workflow running.
    4.  **The "Next Steps" (While the workflow runs):**
        * **Sub-headline:** "The Path Forward"
        * **Narrative/Call to Action:** "This live process demonstrates a superior, safer, and more efficient workflow. My recommendation is to formally adopt the Aethelred system as the standard process for all new and updated technical documentation company-wide."
* **Assets Required:**
    * A pre-generated PDF to showcase.
    * A live, deployed private site with Decap CMS running.

### **Page 5: Project Structure Guide (The "Appendix")**

* **Purpose:** To act as a technical reference that demonstrates the depth of planning and organization. It proves the system is not an ad-hoc script but a well-structured project.
* **Content & Narrative:**
    1.  **Primary Headline:** "Project Structure Guide"
    * **Content:** This page will contain the full text of the "Project Structure Guide" we created previously, detailing the repository layout and the component-based authoring model.
* **Assets Required:** None (page content is pre-written).
