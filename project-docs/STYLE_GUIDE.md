# Project Unidoc Style Guide

**Version 1.0 - Definitive Writing and Formatting Standards**

## üìã Overview

This style guide defines the writing tone, terminology, and formatting standards for all Project Unidoc technical documentation. Adherence to these standards ensures consistency, professionalism, and accessibility across all company manuals.

## üéØ Writing Principles

### Tone and Voice
- **Professional yet approachable**: Clear, confident, and helpful
- **User-focused**: Always consider the reader's perspective and needs
- **Concise and direct**: Eliminate unnecessary words and complexity
- **Action-oriented**: Use active voice and clear imperatives

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Workshop technicians and field engineers
- **Secondary**: System administrators and technical managers
- **Tertiary**: External customers and service partners

## üìù Writing Standards

### Language Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use present tense for instructions ("Click Save" not "You will click Save")
- Use active voice ("The system generates reports" not "Reports are generated")
- Write in second person for procedures ("You configure the system")
- Use parallel structure in lists and headings
- Write concisely and eliminate filler words

**DON'T:**
- Use future tense unnecessarily
- Use passive voice without good reason
- Include unnecessary technical jargon
- Write overly long sentences (max 25 words)
- Use contractions in formal documentation

### Terminology Standards

#### Company Terms
- **Project Unidoc** (not "project unidoc" or "Unidoc")
- **Ventil Test Equipment** (official company name)
- **CRS10** (not "CRS-10" or "crs10")

#### Technical Terms
- **manual** (not "document" or "guide" unless specifically different)
- **component** (for reusable content pieces)
- **assembly** (for the process of combining components)
- **workflow** (not "work flow")
- **setup** (noun), **set up** (verb)
- **login** (noun), **log in** (verb)

#### Capitalization
- **Sentence case** for headings (not Title Case)
- **Initial caps** for proper nouns and official product names
- **Lowercase** for generic technical terms (unless starting a sentence)

### Numbers and Units
- Spell out numbers one through nine, use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for all technical specifications and measurements
- Always include units of measurement (GB, MHz, seconds)
- Use consistent decimal notation (1.5, not 1,5)

## üèóÔ∏è Formatting Standards

### Document Structure

#### Required Elements
All manuals must include:
1. **Title page** with manual name, version, and date
2. **Table of contents** (auto-generated)
3. **Introduction** explaining purpose and scope
4. **Main content** organized in logical sections
5. **Appendices** (if applicable)

#### Heading Hierarchy
```
# Level 1: Manual title (once per document)
## Level 2: Major sections
### Level 3: Subsections
#### Level 4: Detailed procedures (limit use)
```

#### Section Numbering
- Use automatic numbering through Pandoc/LaTeX
- Don't manually number sections in markdown
- Maximum 4 levels of nesting

### Content Elements

#### Procedures and Instructions
Format step-by-step procedures as numbered lists:

```markdown
1. **Action verb**: Descriptive explanation
   - Sub-step if needed
   - Additional clarification
   
2. **Next action**: Continue with clear steps
   
3. **Final action**: Complete the procedure
```

#### Code and Commands
- Use `inline code` for file names, commands, and short code
- Use code blocks for multi-line examples
- Always specify the language for syntax highlighting

```bash
# Example command with comment
./assemble.sh --verbose
```

#### Warnings and Notes

Use consistent formatting for callouts:

```markdown
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Critical information that prevents damage or data loss

> **üí° Tip**: Helpful suggestions to improve workflow

> **üìã Note**: Additional context or clarification
```

#### Lists and Bullets
- Use **bold** for the key term or action in bullet lists
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Use numbered lists for sequential procedures
- Use bullet lists for non-sequential items

### Tables and Diagrams

#### Table Formatting
- Include clear headers for all columns
- Align numerical data to the right
- Align text data to the left
- Keep tables simple and scannable

#### Images and Diagrams
- Include alternative text for all images
- Use consistent image sizing and placement
- Number figures if referenced in text
- Store images in `docs/assets/images/`
